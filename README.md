## Face Generation using DCGAN

Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate new examples which are not in the original dataset. DCGAN, or Deep Convolutional GAN, is such a network architechture that is capable of generating RGB images of size 64x64. The idea of Deep Convolutional generative adversarial network was proposed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434v1).
